# Description
This is a template to create a moodle auth plugin, with simple examples.
# Usage
Replace all `{{plugin_name}}` marks with your plugin name (under line format) like `name_for_plugin`, it will be your own project, remember to delete `.git` folder.  
One thing else: edit `db/install.xml ` to define your own table.

# Other
I will write the replace script if I have spare time.
